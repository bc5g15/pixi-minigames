1. Slide lock
Drag the icon across the highlighted path to solve the puzzle
Do I want to allow pure dragging but reset the position if the player
slides outside the path, or fix the point so that it can only be dragged
along the path?

Dragging along a path might be easier, although I'll have to think
about how it can be achieved.

3. Picture code lock
A numerical lock, except the numbers are replaced
with weird symbols.

4. Switch bar lock
Sequence of toggle buttons
Each button has an on/off state which adds numbers
to a couple of bars in the viewpoint.
The player must get both bars into an acceptable state,
which requires the correct combination of switches.
